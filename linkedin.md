## Viral Strategies

1. **Consistency**: Post at least **3-4 times per week** to maintain engagement.
2. **Storytelling**: Write engaging and relatable content instead of just facts.
3. **Engage with Others**: Comment on trending posts in tech before posting yours.
4. **Use Hooks**: Start posts with a **question or surprising fact** to grab attention.
5. **Visuals & Videos**: Use infographics, project demos, and short videos.
6. **Tag Relevant People**: Engage mentors, peers, and communities for reach.
7. **Use Trending Hashtags**: Keep a mix of general and niche hashtags.
8. **Ask Questions**: Encourage discussions to boost post engagement.
9. **Cross Promote**: Share posts in relevant LinkedIn groups and Discord communities.
10. **Leverage Polls**: Use LinkedIn polls to increase interaction.

## Engagement Checklist

- ✅ Reply to every comment on your post.
- ✅ Engage with 5-10 posts of others daily.
- ✅ Share insights in comments of trending posts.
- ✅ Invite peers to collaborate on posts.

### 🔍 **1. Boolean Search Like a Hacker**
Use **Google** with site:linkedin.com to bypass LinkedIn limitations and dig deeper.

**Example:**
```bash
site:linkedin.com/in/ AND ("React Developer" OR "Frontend Developer") AND ("hiring" OR "open to work") AND ("Bangalore" OR "Remote")
```

You can add:
- `intitle:"React Developer"` to search only profile titles.
- `"currently hiring"` to find HRs/recruiters with current openings.

---

### 🧠 **2. Filter Recruiters Using Keywords**
In LinkedIn’s search bar, type:

```plaintext
Recruiter AND (React OR Node OR Python) AND "looking to hire"
```

Then filter by **People**, **Location**, or **Past companies**. Hit up these people directly with a short, customized message — like:
> “Hey [Name], noticed you're hiring for [Role]. I’ve worked on similar projects and would love to connect!”

---

### 🧨 **3. Content Hijacking Trick**
Go to **#Hiring**, **#hiringnow**, or **#RemoteJobs** — but don’t scroll randomly.

Instead, sort by **Latest** posts. Then **comment early** (within 30 mins), something like:
> “Would love to explore this opportunity! Profile aligns well with the role — sending a DM shortly.”

Early engagement = visibility to recruiters.

---

### 💬 **4. Drop ‘Easter Egg’ Comments on Company Pages**
Go to the company’s **LinkedIn page**, check **posts made by HRs or leadership**, and comment something genuine like:
> “Love the product direction — curious if you're expanding the dev team this quarter?”

This triggers curiosity and might land you in their DMs.

---

### 🎯 **5. Job Alerts 2.0 – Geo + Title Hack**
Create custom alerts using keywords like:
- `Frontend Developer Remote`
- `Blockchain Internship Mumbai`
- `Startup Software Engineer Equity`

Then **save job alerts** with highly specific roles + location combos to beat the crowd.

---

### 🛠️ **6. Use GitHub + LinkedIn Combo**
Search GitHub profiles using:
```bash
site:github.com "location Mumbai" "React developer"
```

Then find those devs on LinkedIn — if they recently switched jobs or posted “I’m hiring,” you’ve found a lead.

---

### 🧩 **7. Use LinkedIn's Hidden Hashtags**
These aren’t always trending but recruiters use them:
- `#nowhiring`
- `#techhiring`
- `#developerswanted`
- `#startupjobs`
- `#wearehiring`
- `#jointheteam`

Search and sort by **Posts → Latest**, then directly connect/comment.

---

### 🕵️ **8. Search by Stealth Mode**
Turn on **Private Mode** in LinkedIn settings → stalk all you want without alerting anyone. Use it to study hiring managers' and recruiters’ activity.

---

### 🧬 **9. Scrape LinkedIn with Phantombuster or Bardeen**
Use [Phantombuster](https://phantombuster.com/) or [Bardeen.ai](https://www.bardeen.ai/) to extract:
- Recruiter emails
- Job poster profiles
- Candidate data (to see what resumes are working)

You can build your own mini-ATS and reach out strategically.

---

### 🧨 **10. Ghost Apply Technique**
Apply for a job → don’t wait → find the recruiter on LinkedIn who posted it → send a DM like:
> “Hey [Name], I applied for [Role] but wanted to directly express interest. My background in [X] might align well with your goals.”

Most people don’t do this. You’ll stand out.

---

### 🧪 Bonus Unreal Hack: **Reverse Search the Job Poster**
For job posts with "Posted by [Name]", click the name → see all past job posts → check what kind of people they usually hire.

Tailor your resume/portfolio using their previous choices (stealth mode optional 😏).
